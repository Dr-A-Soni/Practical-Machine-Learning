# Practical-Machine-Learning
Practical Machine Learning Course Project- Week 4
# Overview:

This assignment consist of developing a machine learning algorithm to the 20 test cases which are available with this project and test the data while submitting the predictions in appropriate format so that it is reproducible and answering the prediction quiz following this project. 

# Background:

There are many devices that are available in the market to collect large amount of data relating to personal activity such as Jawbone up, Nike FuelBand and Fitbit.
These devices are part of the quantifies self movements wherein group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to imporve their health, and find patterns in their behaviour, or because they are tech geeks.
Activities are quantifies regularly on how much they do but no one quantifies how well they  do, hence this project sheds some light on that as well.

# GOAL:
The Goal of this project is to use the data from the accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.

These participants are asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways, and data is noted.

This project is based on the research which was carried out in the past, and to gain more insight about the specifics following website is available to lookout for.
